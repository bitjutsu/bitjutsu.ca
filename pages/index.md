# I'm Adam. I write text files for money.

*Well, actually...*I'm a software developer living in Vancouver.

I currently work for [CloudOps](https://cloudops.com) on our flagship product, [CloudMC](https://cloudops.com/cloudmc), which is a cloud platform orchestrator. I develop integrations for cloud services, write plugins for open source cloud tools, and work on the business-oriented components of CloudMC Core.

I also develop open-source software. I try to use my projects to learn about new technologies and shipping software, which pushed me to learn about unit testing, try a variety of build systems, author documentation, and learn about behaviour-driven and test-driven development.

In my spare time, I enjoy playing guitar, writing, cooking, and reading books - currently I'm reading *The Creative Destruction of New York City*. I've also spent the last few years learning French. I've enjoyed the challenge of learning a second language so much that since moving to Vancouver, I've begun taking Mandarin classes.
