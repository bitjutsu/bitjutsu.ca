I'm Adam. I write text files for money.
=======================================
*Well, actually...*I'm a fourth year computer science undergrad at McGill.

In my spare time, I'm a volunteer tutor for the McGill Computer Science Undergraduate Society Help Desk.

I also develop open-source software. I try to use my projects to learn about shipping software effectively, which has pushed me to do unit testing, try a variety of build systems, author documentation, and learn about behaviour-driven development.<br>

My most recent work experience was as a consultant at [ERP Guru](http://erpguru.com), a NetSuite consulting firm in Montréal. As a member of the eCommerce team, I was heavily involved in the development, migration, and go-live of multiple large-scale eCommerce sites. I was also a mentor to four employees in the four months I spent at ERP Guru, and I took it upon myself to make sure the team was always motivated and in high spirits.<br>
