<p><em>Well, actually...</em>I'm a software developer living in Vancouver.</p>
<p>I currently work for <a href="https://cloudops.com">CloudOps</a> on our flagship product, <a href="https://cloudops.com/cloudmc">CloudMC</a>, which is a cloud platform orchestrator. I develop integrations for cloud services, write plugins for open source cloud tools, and work on the business-oriented components of CloudMC Core.</p>

<p>I also develop open-source software. I try to use my projects to learn about new technologies and shipping software, which has pushed me to learn about unit testing, try a variety of build systems, author documentation, and learn about behaviour-driven and test-driven development.<br></p>
<p><em><a href="/projects">Projects→</a></em></p>
<p>In my spare time, I enjoy playing guitar, writing, cooking, and reading books - currently I'm reading <em>The Design of Everyday Things</em>. I've spent the last few years learning French, both in school and in everyday life, which has been a challenge I deeply enjoy.</p>
<p><em>I'm on the internet!</em><br> More specifically, I'm on <a href="http://ca.linkedin.com/in/adamcarruthers/">LinkedIn</a> and <a href="https://github.com/prollynomial">GitHub</a>.</p></main>
