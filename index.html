<p><em>Well, actually...</em>I'm a software developer living in Vancouver.</p>
<p>My most recent work experience was at MindGeek, where I designed and built an advertisement insights platform similar to Google Analytics. In production, it handles up to 55,000 events per second, and provides up-to-the-minute insights into how the ads are performing, and what content the average user is interested in. A screenshot of the dashboard is available <a href="/assets/pulse-screenshot.png">here</a>.<br> <em><a href="/assets/resume.pdf">Resume→</a></em></p>
<p>In my spare time, I enjoy playing guitar, writing, cooking, and reading books - currently I'm reading <em>The Design of Everyday Things</em>. I'm also learning French, both in school and in everyday life, which is a challenge I deeply enjoy.</p>
<p>I also develop open-source software. I try to use my projects to learn about new technologies and shipping software, which has pushed me to learn about unit testing, try a variety of build systems, author documentation, and learn about behaviour-driven and test-driven development.<br> <em><a href="/projects">Projects→</a></em></p>
<p><em>I'm on the internet!</em><br> More specifically, I'm on <a href="http://ca.linkedin.com/in/adamcarruthers/">LinkedIn</a> and <a href="https://github.com/prollynomial">GitHub</a>.</p>
