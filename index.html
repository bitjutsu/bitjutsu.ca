<p><em>Well, actually...</em>I'm a software developer living in Vancouver.</p>
<p>I currently work for <a href="https://cloudops.com">CloudOps</a> on our flagship product, <a href="https://cloudops.com/cloudmc">CloudMC</a>, which is a cloud platform orchestrator. I develop integrations for cloud services, write plugins for open source cloud tools, and work on the business-oriented components of CloudMC Core.</p>
<p><em><a href="/assets/resume.pdf">Resume→</a></em></p>
<p>I also develop open-source software. I try to use my projects to learn about new technologies and shipping software, which pushed me to learn about unit testing, try a variety of build systems, author documentation, and learn about behaviour-driven and test-driven development.</p>
<p><em><a href="/projects">Projects→</a></em></p>
<p>In my spare time, I enjoy playing guitar, writing, cooking, and reading books - currently I'm reading <em>The Creative Destruction of New York City</em>. I've also spent the last few years learning French. I've enjoyed the challenge of learning a second language so much that since moving to Vancouver, I've begun taking Mandarin classes.</p>
