I'm Adam. I write text files for money.
=======================================
*Well, actually...*I'm a software developer living in Vancouver.

My most recent work experience was at MindGeek, where I designed and built an advertisement insights platform similar to Google Analytics. In production, it handles up to 55,000 events per second, and provides up-to-the-minute insights into how the ads are performing, and what content the average user is interested in. A screenshot of the dashboard is available [here](/assets/pulse-screenshot.png).<br>

In my spare time, I enjoy playing guitar, writing, cooking, and reading books - currently I'm reading *The Design of Everyday Things*. I'm also learning French, both in school and in everyday life, which is a challenge I deeply enjoy.

I also develop open-source software. I try to use my projects to learn about new technologies and shipping software, which has pushed me to learn about unit testing, try a variety of build systems, author documentation, and learn about behaviour-driven and test-driven development.<br>
